README for RPG_Game

Just a silly game I created for a class, to show I understood how Markov Chains worked. 

To play, you will need all the files (yes, all of them). Run the file named "RPGGameDMfixNEW.m", and it will automatically call whichever functions it needs.

Originally made in 2014, when I was only a couple years into programming. It can be improved, for sure, but again it was done as a fun class project. Feel free to play/make changes, but if you reupload, please mention/link me! <3

P.S. I am a Big Bang Theory fan, and there is an easter egg in the game. CHeck out the code if you are having trouble finding it!
